## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Per-account label cleanup: review an account's labels in a checklist (app-created ones pre-selected) and bulk-delete the ones you don't want. Mail is never deleted — labels only.
- Real Gmail profile photos displayed as circular avatars throughout the panel.
- Editable categories applied as Gmail labels and surfaced as loop tags in the panel.
- Categories editor in Settings for managing per-account category sets.
- 10 Liquid-Glass delight moments: ambient animations, spring transitions, and haptic cues.

### Changed

- Settings tab redesigned with cleaner layout and a redesigned "Learned from your actions" section.
- App now runs from `~/Library/Application Support` (TCC-safe, location-independent); no longer requires a source checkout to be present.
- De-personalized internal identifiers to remove hard-coded personal references.

### Fixed

- `photo_url` decoding fix: avatars now load reliably for accounts with encoded profile URLs.
- Orphaned-label-on-rename fix: renaming a category no longer leaves stale Gmail labels behind.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24

Initial public release.

- Reversible multi-account Gmail triage: archive and label, never delete.
- Agent-judged open loops: Claude (Haiku) reads each thread against your keep policy and decides what still needs you.
- Reply in your voice: draft replies from the panel using optional voice-grounding files.
- Native macOS 26 Liquid Glass menu-bar app with a popover panel.
- `.dmg` installer with guided onboarding for first-time setup.
